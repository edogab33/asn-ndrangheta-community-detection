# Analysis of Social Network

For the course of Analysis of Social Network (Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana) one of the assignments is about community detection.

Here I worked on the detecting of the community structure of the Italian 'Ndrangheta organization. 
The dataset is extrapolated by UCINET from the so called document "Operazione Infinito". More information can be found in the introduction and reference sections of the report.
