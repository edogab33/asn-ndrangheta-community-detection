# ASN - Detecting communities in the 'Ndrangheta organization

For the course of Analysis of Social Network (Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana) one of the assignments is about community detection.

Here I worked on the detecting of the community structure of the Italian 'Ndrangheta organization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Ndrangheta). 
The dataset is extrapolated by UCINET from the so called document "Operazione Infinito". More information can be found in the introduction and reference sections of the report.
